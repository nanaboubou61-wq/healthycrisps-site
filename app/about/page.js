     <p className="p">
  Healthy Crisps is a homegrown business proudly created in the UAE.
</p>

<p className="p">
  The idea began with a very personal search. Our founder was looking for a snack that could be enjoyed every day without guilt. Something light, clean, and satisfying. A snack that would not feel heavy, processed, or loaded with unnecessary calories.
</p>

<p className="p">
  At the same time, there was a longing for familiar flavor. A taste of Lebanon. The comfort of traditional zaatar, simple ingredients, and honest food. Nothing available truly combined health and flavor in the way it should.
</p>

<p className="p">
  That is when Healthy Crisps was born.
</p>

<p className="p">
  Each Zaatar Crisp contains only <strong>3 calories</strong>. This was not an afterthought. It was the reason the business exists. The goal was simple: to create a snack that people could enjoy freely, without counting, without compromise, and without guilt.
</p>

<p className="p">
  By using all-natural ingredients and a careful baking process, Healthy Crisps delivers real flavor in the lightest possible way. Just a touch of olive oil, authentic zaatar, and simple ingredients, baked slowly for a clean, satisfying crunch.
</p>

<p className="p">
  What started as a personal need quickly became a mission. A mission to share a healthier, low-calorie snack with the world. One that proves great taste does not need to come at a cost.
</p>

<p className="p">
  Healthy Crisps is prepared in a licensed kitchen in the UAE, made in small batches, and launched with one signature flavor, Zaatar Crisps. More flavors are coming soon.
</p>

<p className="p">
  This is just the beginning.
